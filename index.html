          <p>An augmented reality (AR) game for Android that features player vs AI gameplay &amp; makes use of AR marker manipulation to do cool things in the game.</p>
          <p>
            Robo Conflict is a turn-based strategy game where the player controls a team of robots against a team of AI robots on a hexagonal grid, and has to destroy the enemy team to win.
            The AI makes use of behaviour trees for decision-making, A* pathfinding &amp; Minimax algorithm.
            The main highlight of the game is a feature which lets the player tilt the AR marker to causes all the robots on the grid to fall towards the direction the marker was tilted to.
          </p>
          <p> The project was created to demonstrate the feasibility of AR marker manipulation as a part of main gameplay mechanics &amp; to showcase our AI design. </p>

            The project was created to demonstrate my skills in graphics programming. It was written in C++ using the freeGLUT library and makes use of computer graphics fundamentals
            such as working with vectors, matrices for 3D transformations, lighting &amp; billboarding.
