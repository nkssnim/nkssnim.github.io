        <h2>Game developer|Web developer</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a 19 year old student from Singapore. <br/>
          I make games in Unity and I've also made games in C++ with OpenGL. <br/>
          I have experience as a full-stack web developer working with HTML, CSS, Javascript &amp; PHP. <br/>
          <br/>I go by several aliases online - mainly nkss, nkssnim &amp; nyangkosense. Nyangkosense is a name I stole from a Starcraft player, not knowing what
          it originally meant. I found out that it was a reference to the fat cat from Natsume's Book of Friends. I also go by 'Fat Cat' as a coincidence from this.

            Targeted at the students of Temasek Culinary Academy in Temasek Polytechnic as part of their course in Culinary &amp; Catering Management.
            The simulation involves preparing a dining table for seating by guests in a fine-dining restaurant. The students are timed and have to complete
            the procedure within a specified time limit in order to demonstrate their aptitude.

          <p>An augmented reality (AR) game for Android that features player vs AI gameplay &amp; makes use of AR marker manipulation to do cool things in the game.</p>
          <p>
            Robo Conflict is a turn-based strategy game where the player controls a team of robots against a team of AI robots on a hexagonal grid, and has to destroy the enemy team to win.
            The AI makes use of behaviour trees for decision-making, A* pathfinding &amp; Minimax algorithm.
            The main highlight of the game is a feature which lets the player tilt the AR marker to causes all the robots on the grid to fall towards the direction the marker was tilted to.
          </p>
          <p> The project was created to demonstrate the feasibility of AR marker manipulation as a part of main gameplay mechanics &amp; to showcase our AI design. </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The project was created to demonstrate my skills in graphics programming. It was written in C++ using the freeGLUT library and makes use of computer graphics fundamentals
            such as working with vectors, matrices for 3D transformations, lighting &amp; billboarding.

            Kaijuu Trainer is a game created to promote exercising for students at Temasek Polytechnic. It intended to accomplish this by having them walk around the campus to collect digital pets &amp;
            randomly encounter different types of monsters in different parts of the campus. They would battle these monsters with their pets to make them stronger. Located in different parts of the campus
            would also be QR codes which can be scanned to heal their pets &amp; battle stronger boss monsters which drop eggs that hatch into new pets.

        <p>
          From a young age, I'd never spared a thought for skill acquisition despite the fact that I tended to pick things up very quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
        Starting from the age of 16, I made a point to learn as many things as possible and obtain proficiency in multiple disciplines in order to achieve my goal of becoming a <i>"slightly less than perfect"</i> human being - the closest real world analogy being a polymath.
        This has resulted in me having a wide range of interests that I've discovered over the years.
        </p>
        <p> The following is a list of things that I like/study in no particular order:</p>
        <div class="interests-description">
        <ul>
          <li>Computer Science - Web Development, Game Development, Cryptography</li>
          <li>Music - Analysis, Composition (Guitar)</li>
          <li>Mathematics (Discrete, Calculus, Game Theory)</li>
          <li>Biology (Biotechnology, Medicine, Pharmacology)</li>
          <li>Mechatronics &amp; Electrical Engineering</li>
          <li>Audio Engineering &amp; Tech Theatre</li>
          <li>Languages - English, Japanese, Chinese, Malay/Indonesian &amp; and a few more with minimal proficiency</li>
          <li>Quirky things - Wet Shaving, Cardistry, Calligraphy</li>
