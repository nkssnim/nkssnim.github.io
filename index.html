          <p>An augmented reality (AR) game for Android that features player vs AI gameplay &amp; makes use of AR marker manipulation to do cool things in the game.</p>
          <p>
            Robo Conflict is a turn-based strategy game where the player controls a team of robots against a team of AI robots on a hexagonal grid, and has to destroy the enemy team to win.
            The AI makes use of behaviour trees for decision-making, A* pathfinding &amp; Minimax algorithm.
            The main highlight of the game is a feature which lets the player tilt the AR marker to causes all the robots on the grid to fall towards the direction the marker was tilted to.
          </p>
          <p> The project was created to demonstrate the feasibility of AR marker manipulation as a part of main gameplay mechanics &amp; to showcase our AI design. </p>

          <p>
            Kaijuu Trainer is a game created to promote exercising for students at Temasek Polytechnic. It intended to accomplish this by having them walk around the campus to collect digital pets &amp;
            randomly encounter different types of monsters in different parts of the campus. They would battle these monsters with their pets to make them stronger. Located in different parts of the campus
            would also be QR codes which can be scanned to heal their pets &amp; battle stronger boss monsters which drop eggs that hatch into new pets.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The project earned a distinction &amp; was showcased as one of the best mobile games created in the Game Design &amp; Development Course in Temasek Polytechnic in the year 2017.</b>
